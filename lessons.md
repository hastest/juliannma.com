I offer Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Master Instruction in Piano with a personalized curriculum at yoour residence with your piano. For recurring lessons, my standard rate for is $100/hour payable as a monthly fee, with a predetermined schedule.
I request a 1 hour minimum per lesson in order to justify the commute, and charge in 30 minute increments.

If you wish to hire me, but do not have access to an instrument, I will book space at [Michiko Studios(https://www.michikostudios.com/) (149 West 46th) or similar space at the student's expense (generally $15-$50). I am fluent in english, french, chinese.
