Private Piano Instruction
=========================

I maintain a studio of private students in New York, and offer Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Master Instruction in Piano with a personalized curriculum at yoour residence with your piano.
For recurring lessons, my standard rate for is **$100/hour** payable as a monthly fee, with a pre-arranged schedule.
I request a *1 hour minimum per lesson* in order to justify the commute, and charge in *30 minute* increments.

If you wish to hire me, but do not have access to an instrument, I will book space at [Michiko Studios](https://www.michikostudios.com/) (149 West 46th) or similar space at the student's expense (generally $15-$50, depending on the instrument).

I am fluent in English, French, Chinese.
