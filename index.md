Fall 2016 will bear witness to Juliann’s latest ensemble work, *SEAs (‘Sustainable Environment through the Arts and Sciences’)**—an original concert-plus-music video project featuring Juilliard choreographers performing alongside Juliann at the piano and telling, through movement and wordless sound, the story of climate change and human impact on nature. Her work is supported through Marin Alsop’s Entrepreneurship Award and the generous dedication of her friends from Juilliard, Parsons, and Stanford University.

> Her performance revealed more than her touch and effortless dazzling finger speed…
> Her musicality, her ability to draw from the mass of musical notations Chopin showers onto the page the essence of his message, is what makes her brilliant.
> It is a gift from some higher power.
> <cite>Keith Kreitman, San Mateo County Times</cite>
