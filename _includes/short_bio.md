Hailing from the San Francisco Bay Area, {{ 'now' | date: "%s" | minus: site.birthday | divided_by: 31536000 }}-year-old pianist **Juliann Ma** is completing her Professional Studies at [Mannes, The New School for Music](http://www.newschool.edu/mannes/) in New York City.
Passionate about academia, arts, and international education, she pursued degrees at Stanford University (full scholarship), the École Normale Supérieure de Musique de Paris «Alfred Cortot» (Fulbright grant), and The Juilliard School (Gluck Fellow), earning the Bachelor of Arts in Music with Honors and Distinction, a minor in Creative Writing, the Diplôme d’Exécution de Piano, and the Master of Music.
Recent performance venues include Bing Concert Hall, Gilder Lehrman Hall, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Dôme des Grandes Écuries, Hitachi Systems Hall Sendai, Konzertsaal Bundesallee, Salle Cortot, Schoenberg Haus, Three Palms Montego Bay, and Weill Recital Hall (Carnegie).
She pursues her dream of revolutionizing world education through collaborative, cross-cultural, and interdisciplinary projects, writing and directing original live and motion picture performances which mold music, dance, and drama into a modern, seamless, storytelling medium.
Her most recent works include a live illustration of Schumann’s Carnaval Op. 9 through piano performance coupled with modern dance improvisation, and a retelling of Ellen Taaffe Zwilich’s Peanuts Gallery piano concerto through a blend of pantomime, ballroom dance, and jazz piano-plus-percussion improvisation.
