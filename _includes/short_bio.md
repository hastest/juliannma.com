Hailing from the San Francisco Bay Area, Juliann Ma is Pro Musicis International Artist of the year. She works toward making art music accessible and available to all by extending the language of classical music through her collaborative, multicultural projects to combine diverse narratives of music, dance, and drama into a modern, seamless storytelling medium.

Juliann graduated with honors from Stanford University with degrees in music and creative writing, and attended École Normale Supérieure de Musique de Paris as a Fulbright scholar. She then earned her Master of Music at The Juilliard School and completed a professional studies diploma at Mannes (the New School), where she developed a strong voice in entrepreneurship. Juliann founded an interdisciplinary arts and science collective, SEAS, which has garnered critical attention and support from acclaimed arts organizations including The New School, Pro Musicis International and Yamaha, and received several awards. Since her graduation, Juliann has collaborated with world musicians at Caroga Lake Festival, and the Silkroad Ensemble’s Global Musician Workshop.

Juliann teaches piano and improvisation at Avenues World School, and maintains a studio of private students in New York. She has performed in a variety of venues, large and small, including Bing Concert Hall, Gilder Lehrman Hall, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Dôme des Grandes Écuries, Hitachi Systems Hall at Sendai, Konzertsaal Bundesallee, Salle Cortot, Schoenberg Haus, Three Palms Montego Bay, and Carnegie.

In her spare time, Juliann writes, paints, sails, and finds inspiration from nature and her city.
