SEAS: Sustainable Environment through the Arts & Sciences
===========================================================

Recognizing climate change and environmental sustainability as rapidly growing global concerns still largely unaddressed and poorly understood by many, Juliann began her search for new languages to spark conversation between unlikely collaborators to address these issues together; thus, SEAS was born.

A melting pot of eclectic talents, SEAS unites artists and environmental research experts in creating visceral, unique performing arts experiences that immerse audiences and themselves in the story of human's impact on nature. Its mission: humanize and make felt the science of climate change through empathetic performances on stage and screen. SEAS seeks to challenge and diversify traditional roles, settings, and audiences of classical music, contemporary dance, and scientific research publications, providing an innovative platform for professionals and audiences to interact, develop appreciation for, share ideas, and co-create across fields so often segregated from one another and which may benefit each other in ways as yet undiscovered.

## Rise, Awaken

{% include plumbing/youtube.html video_id="XnPsKIL-zqQ" %}

In their debut music video, SEAS draws us into the world of birds. The artists step into the skins of a species endangered by our continued exploitation of our environment and are transported instantly into their realm, fraught with hunger, disease, plastics, pollution, deforestation, fires, and oil spills. Trapped in bird bodies, the artists undergo a transformation, until the human spirit and bird are one, suffering and diminishing together.

It is Juliann’s hope that these works will stir audiences to take an active role in safeguarding the home they share with all life on Earth through mindful lifestyle practices (e.g. responsible recycling, composting, disposing, keeping up to date on environmental news, research, and policy), outreach, education, support for sustainable energy and conservation efforts.


## Events

SEAS will be featured in a special live segment in Juliann’s [solo debut at Carnegie Hall's Weill Recital Hall](/concerts-gatherings/) November 9th.
Seating is limited; please [RSVP here](https://www.carnegiehall.org/SiteCode/Purchase/SeatSelectionPerformance.aspx?startWorkflow=true&quickBuy=false&quantity=1&eventId=31030).

Previously, SEAS presented their first Open Workshop May of 2016, testing and building upon their choreography live in an interactive demonstration and discussion workshop with the audience. In November the same year, SEAS, gave its world premiere performances of Ravel's complete ***Miroirs*** suite as part of Mannes Sounds Festival: Mirrors of Nature, curated by J.Y. Song.

## Support

***Rise, Awaken*** was made possible in part thanks to the Marin Alsop Entrepreneurship Award and Father Merlet Grant. SEAS salutes Maestro Marin Alsop (Baltimore Symphony Orchestra), Norma Deull, and Pro Musicis Foundation for their support through these grants, and to Mannes: The New School for Music and Yamaha Artist Services Inc. for generous extension of their resources.
