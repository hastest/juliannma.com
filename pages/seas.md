## Sustainable Environment through the Arts and Sciences

An original concert-plus-music video project featuring Juilliard choreographers performing alongside Juliann at the piano and telling, through movement and wordless sound, the story of climate change and human impact on nature. Her work is supported through Marin Alsopâ€™s Entrepreneurship Award and the generous dedication of her friends from Juilliard, Parsons, and Stanford University.
