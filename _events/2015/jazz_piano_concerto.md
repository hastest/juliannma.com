At the premiere of Rhapsody in Blue, Gershwin described his new piano concerto as “an experiment in modern music” – suffusing a classical form with jazz sensibility. It was a huge success, and classical composers quickly followed suit, most notably Ravel in the two concertos he composed at the end of the 1920’s. A more recent take is Ellen Taaffe Zwilich’s Peanuts Gallery (1996), a delightful set of musical portraits of Snoopy, Lucy, and other characters in the Peanuts comic strip. –J.Y. Song, curator

Blue note: Peanuts Gallery will feature some fun interdisciplinary surprises, featuring Stanford University alumni and Viennese Ball Committee members Peter Bullen & M.J. Ma, as well as actors Calvin Rezen and Michelle Cage from The New School for Drama. Pianist and improviser Chi-Wei Lo (Juilliard) will be joining me in cooking our own special version of the Zwilich’s concerto. Enjoy!
