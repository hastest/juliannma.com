About Caroga Arts Collective:

The Caroga Arts Collective (Caroga Arts) is the newly established not-for-profit organization which acts as an umbrella for the Caroga Lake Music Festival, and other projects (Sherman's Center for Collaborative Arts and Education).

We seek to bring together a community of artists to collaborate across fields and genres on interdisciplinary projects. Caroga Arts focuses on revitalizing local culture, business, and life through providing unique experiences via collaborative performances, exhibits, community outreach events and adult/ youth education.

As an extension of the individuals who participate and support the Caroga Lake Music Festival, Caroga Arts strives to bring diverse art, education, adn experiences to Caroga year-round with a focus on community growth and international impact.
