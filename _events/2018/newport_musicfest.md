Romantic composers Schumann and Rachmaninoff are displayed in a delightful morning concert of two pianos, two pianists, four hands. Opening with Robert Schumann’s Carnaval Op. 9, twenty-one short pieces comprise this intriguing exploration of pre-Lenten festival celebrations. The music is daring and delightful, a bright example of his musical gifts. The glory of Rachmaninoff is displayed in the second half of the morning’s concert, beginning with Nine Études-Tableaux Op. 39. They are glorious and rousing, exploding in complex sound that inspires and invigorates, then settling into contemplative exploration that is soothing, yet inspiring. The morning concert closes with Rachmaninoff’s Suite Op. 17 No. 2, a set of pieces composed for two pianos. In each movement, the parts are intricately connected, demanding virtuosity from each pianist. This concert is an exciting adventure into the heart of exquisite Romanticism.
