We at the SEAS project invite you to join us at New York's Yamaha Artist Services for an interactive concert and open discussion of our responsibilities in the face of a changing climate, and our common aspiration to manage human impact on our environment, and to achieve sustainability.

Plastic, Coral, & Ice bring together leaders from diverse fields including music, dance, film, science, and education to join the audience in an open discussion of of our shared responsibility to better our environment.

Given the limited reach of scientific publication, and the polarizing nature of the topic, communicating the subtle gravitas of climate change is notoriously challenging. SEAS attempts instead to communicate this global issue as a visceral, emotional message via its unique collaboration. We distill the scientific argument into an accessible message expressed as a performance, tangibly felt and easily shared.

The event will feature live performances of music and choreography inspired by recent environmental observations, including two world premieres: a story of plastics in the ocean, and of disappearing ice. Also featured are musical classics reinterpreted as calls to save coral reefs, seabirds, and address other stresses on our planet.

Each performance will be introduced by Jared Brewer (PhD candidate in Atmospheric Science, CSU; NOAA), who will also lead a Q&A session to reinforce, and discuss the goals and messaging of SEAS.

SEAS will also present our debut music video, and discuss the storied history of the formation of our artistic collective. The event will be filmed and edited into a mini-documentary, in the hopes that it may inspire action beyond the guests of the the event.

Please join us on April 11, at 7pm, and bring an open mind and a desire to do good. Entry is free and open to all, but you are encouraged to support our work via a [donation](https://www.paypal.me/juliannma). This event, and our continued collaboration is made possible by generous support from our [sponsors](/seas/#support).
