[Max Reger: the man and his music"](https://events.newschool.edu/event/maxreger#.VwrmDhMrKRs) will feature an entire evening of Max Regerâ€™s music, honoring the 100th year since his death. I will be performing selections of his beautiful Silhouetten for the piano, and a selection from his violin sonata in C with violinist Mengyi Cao. With contributions from our Mannes musicians.
