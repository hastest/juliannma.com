On Welcome Day, my fellow Alsop award winners and I will present each of our entrepreneurial projects as part of a public launch for our work. Features a roundtable discussion with Marin Alsop and the award winners, and a panel discussion with Marin Alsop, Nick Firth, Margaret Lioi, Leslie Stifelman, and **Richard Kessler on innovation in the performing arts**.

“Music students today must learn to navigate within an increasingly fractured and complex professional landscape in order to be successful in their careers”, says Richard Kessler, Dean of Mannes School of Music and Executive Dean for The College of Performing Arts. “The Alsop Entrepreneurship Award is one way that we prepare students for this new and still shifting paradigm. Conceiving of, pitching, and executing innovative projects in music entrepreneurship helps our students to develop greater agency and encourages them to engage with the larger social, cultural, and artistic questions of our time.”
This year, three winning projects were selected by committee members **Margaret Lioi, CEO of Chamber Music America; Leslie Stifelman, Peabody Award Winning conductor, pianist, producer and consultant; and Nicholas Firth, businessman and former Chairman and CEO of BMG Music Publishing.** Award winners are using their funding to envision new musical solutions to big human problems – changing how audiences hear the science of climate change, making classical music accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing, and shining a light on the essential and invisible features of musicianship in the symphony orchestra.

My project is described below as excerpted/ edited from the **press release:

Sustainable Environment through the Arts and Sciences (SEAS):** A performance project combining performing artists and environmental researchers.

SEAS is a new interdisciplinary performance project that combines music, dance and science to tell the story of climate change. Juliann Ma, a candidate for the Professional Studies Diploma at Mannes, envisions this project a means of changing how audiences think about the ways we interact with our environment by making the science of climate change come alive to our senses.

Ma’s **SEAS Workshop** of the live theatrical performance (anticipated for Fall 2016) will be open to the public and take place at 8 PM on Monday, May 2nd, in the Mannes College’s Stiefel Concert Hall at 55 West 13 Street, New York, NY 10011. Ma’s piano performance will be joined with original choreography created with and portrayed by Juilliard dancers to illustrate a set of data-driven narratives written by Ma based on environmental research conveyed by Stanford University alumnus Jared Brewer.

As part of her Alsop Entrepreneurship Award, Ma will produce a music video of Maurice Ravel’s Oiseaux Tristes (Sad Birds) to engage and attract future partnerships with environmental organizations and sustainable performance venues.
