**Sustainable Environment through the Arts and Sciences (SEAS)** will be working on their music video of Ravel’s “Oiseaux Tristes,” featuring narratives and choreography drawn from current research on birds’ dealings with climate change, pollution, increasing metropolitan glass architecture, and deforestation. I will be directing, with Juilliard dancers working out choreography and a Parsons videographer working out production details and filming. You are all invited to observe this exciting collaborative phenomenon, and welcome!
